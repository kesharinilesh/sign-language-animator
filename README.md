# Sign Language Recognition System

## Overview

The Sign Language Recognition System is a project designed to provide animated representations of recognized words in sign language sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
This system can be used to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the rest of the world by helping people learn the meaning of sign language gestures.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV for computer vision
- TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning
- mediapipe for hand and landmark detection
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- JSON for configuration
- Numpy for numerical operations
